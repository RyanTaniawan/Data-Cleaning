# Data-Cleaning
In this repository I am data-cleaning by using Microsoft SSMS/SQL.
In the Nashville Housing Data Cleaning, there are several cleaning done by SQL such as:
1. Standardizing date format.
2. Fill null property address column.
3. Separating complete address into (address, city, state).
4. Change status in 'Sold as Vacant' column from (Yes, No, Y, N) to (Yes and No) only.
5. Removine duplicates and deleting unused columns.
